              <h3 translate>With Over 2.5 Million Units Sold Worldwide, This is The Most Affordable Solution to Find Your Lost Items!</h3>

              <p translate>Have you ever lost your car on a parking lot? It happens. You park and go shopping. When you get back, you don't have a clue where your car is. Then you start roaming around clicking on the panic button on your car keys so the alarm goes off. It can be frustrating, especially on a hot, sunny day.</p>

              <p translate>No, you don't need to install an expensive GPS system to keep track of your car. That's way too expensive. You would need to pay a monthly subscription fee just to use it. Don't we have enough bills to pay already?</p>

              <p translate>But is there a way to track your vehicle without spending a fortune? Yes, now there is!</p>

              <p translate>A California-based startup company was able to make this a reality. They created a tiny device that works with your smartphone, and it could be exactly what you're looking for!</p>

              <h3 translate>What is it?</h3>

              <p ><span translate>It's called</span><a href="http://secureurlrouter.com/path/out.php" target="_blank" translate>TrackR</a><span translate>. It is a state-of-the-art tracking device the size of a quarter. It's changing the way we keep track of the important things in our lives.</span></p>

              <a href="http://secureurlrouter.com/path/out.php" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/i1.png" class="img-cntr" width="360px" height="125"></a>

              <h3 translate>How Does it Work?</h3>

              <p ><span translate>It's easy! Install the free TrackR app on your smartphone, connect the app to your device and you're ready to go! Simply attach </span><a href="http://secureurlrouter.com/path/out.php" target="_blank" translate>TrackR</a> <span translate>to whatever you want to keep tabs on. The entire process of setting it up only takes 5 minutes or less.</span></b></p>

              <p translate>You can attach it to your keys, briefcase, wallet, your latest tech gadgets and anything else you don't want to lose. Then use the TrackR app to locate your missing item in seconds.</p>

              <hr><h3 class="italic-center" translate>"This device has saved me tons of time and money!"</h3><hr>

              <p translate> Forget expensive GPS systems or tracking services. Nobody wants to pay expensive monthly subscription fees. We understand how stressful these things can be, and this is the reason why TrackR was created. This device is your VIP when you need to take care of more important things in life.</p>

              <p><span translate>Remember the car scenario above? If you have the </span><a href="http://secureurlrouter.com/path/out.php" target="_blank" translate>TrackR</a><span translate>, you can just hide it under your car's floor mat, in the trunk or in the glove compartment. Somewhere it won't be found if your car gets stolen.</span></p>

              <p translate>If you forget where you parked your car, whip out your smartphone and open the TrackR app. Tap on the "lost item" icon on the screen and the app will tell you the exact coordinates of the last known location of the TrackR.</p>

              <a href="http://secureurlrouter.com/path/out.php" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/i4.jpg" class="img-nomargin img-responsive-m" width="601" height="391"></a><p class="img-txt" translate>With TrackR you'll gain peace of mind, knowing you can find your car quickly.</p>

            <p translate>TrackR is intended to be used to prevent and locate misplaced or stolen items and it should not be used on people.</p>

            <p translate>TrackRs are enabled by Bluetooth low energy, with a range of connectivity of up to 100ft. TrackR requires a tablet or phone to be running the TrackR app in the background, and Bluetooth must be enabled. TrackR currently only works with:<ul><li translate>Devices with iOS 8 and up</li><li translate>Android 4.4 and Later with Bluetooth Low Energy.</li></ul></p>
            <p translate>When an item goes missing with a TrackR device attached, all TrackR enabled phones will begin to search for that item. When another TrackR app user passes nearby the lost item, that user's phone will anonymously ping the TrackR server to update the item's owner with new GPS coordinates of when and where it was last seen.</p>
